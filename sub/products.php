        <h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
        
        Here are the first photos of the Volkswagen Golf 7. After months of spy photos, computer renderings, horrible photoshops and more, the official photos have been released. It is hard for us to believe that another generation of Golf has gone by. We launched VWvortex as the Golf 4 was first being introduced and now here we are fifteen years later and the Golf 7 is upon us. We’ve already covered the Golf 7’s new component platform called MQB in this preview article HERE. Likewise we published an extensive technical preview on the Golf 7 HERE which we just updated with new photos. Between both of those article you should find plenty of information to keep you busy for at least 10 minutes.

Here is the short 411 on the Golf 7. The new Golf 7 has lost weight – as much as 220 lbs. depending on the trim level. Compared to the Golf 6, the Golf 7 wheelbase is up 2.3 inches, while the overall length is up 2.2 inches with a marginally smaller front overhang. Overall height is 1.1 inches lower. The front wheels are 1.7 inches further forward giving the car overall sportier proportions. Width is up .5 inches. This all translates into .6 inches more rear leg room and nearly an inch more shoulder and elbow room. The driver has a newly designed cockpit as well, with the center stack controls now tilted towards the driver that include either a 5-inch, 5.8 inch or 8-inch touch screen. Volkswagen’s new touch screen systems feature swipe and pinch gestures as well as a proximity sensor that detects when the hand is coming near the screen and changes the interface graphics in anticipation of where you plan to touch the screen. There is also .8 inches more travel in the front seats and the gear shift has been raised by .75 inches.
